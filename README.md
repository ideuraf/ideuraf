# hey there, i'm syed! ＼(٥⁀▽⁀ )／

I’m [**Syed**](https://www.ideuraf.dev), a computer engineering student @ University of Houston.

I love working on random projects of all kinds, turning late-night ideas into projects that occasionally decide to actually function (and other times just break on `git push`).  My best commits usually happen long after everyone else has gone to sleep anyways.  


Outside of my digital life, you’ll probably find me exploring with a wanderlust for nature, quiet spots, and drawing.
